/**
 * Handler class which performs various methods during a file upload process.
 * Contains default behavior. Implementations are free to redefine the methods or
 * to keep them as they want. Note that using a concrete implementation is required,
 * if no suitable handler is found then the file upload is considered a failure.
 *
 * <p>Each method receives an UploadContext object which contains the information
 * about the file upload process. Its values are expected to change between the
 * method calls or even replaced with a new object, so make sure you carefully check
 * its state.
